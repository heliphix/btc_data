# Time-series forecasting of Bitcoin prices
This repository contains the code and datasets for creating the machine learning models in the research paper titled "Time-series forecasting of Bitcoin prices using high-dimensional features: a machine learning approach" with doi:10.1007/s00521-020-05129-6

## Models considered:
1. LSTM
2. SVM
3. SANN
4. ANN

Feature selection process is based on Pearson correlation, random forest, and variance inflation factor.

## New analysis is submitted to the dev and the main branches.

## The original code is archived in the "research_paper" branch.
